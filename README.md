# Nitinol Stents
This is the Aduino code used in TSCK 222 Nitinol Stents prototype.  A portion of the code 
is taken from an Adafruit example showing how to read a 10K thermistor accurately using the Steinhartâ€“Hart equation.
The beta coefficient of the thermistor is also factored into the equation.  The coefficient is usually in the range of 
3000-4000.  The beta coefficient is usually listed in the thermistor data sheet.
