# Nitinol Stents
This is the Aduino code used in TSCK 222 Nitinol Stents prototype.  A portion of the code 
is taken from an Adafruit example showing how to read a 10K thermistor accurately using the Steinhartâ€“Hart equation.
There also a definition for the beta coefficient of the thermistor.  This is usually in the range of 
3000-4000.
